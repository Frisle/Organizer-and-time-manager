# Work Organizer

The project was created from the frustration of managing a bunch of text files and pdf documents. The goal was to create a centralized place to manage the knowledge base. And since I'm a fan of command interfaces, everything works on commands.

These are two-part console applications: the first for creating and organizing notes and artifacts, the second for keeping track of time spent on work tasks.

What Organizer can do:


Input "-new" and write a new note.
Write your "tag" after it if needed

Input "-cls" to clear the console

Input "-sh" to search the notes by key word
Search notes by key-words in body of a note

Input "-tag" to search the notes by tag word

Input "-copy" to use clipboard
Write your tag after flag if needed

Input "-today" to read today notes

Input "-all" to read all created notes

Input "-order" to open today note by number

Input "-date" to open notes by certain day

Input "-display tags" to view available tags

Input "-conn" to view list of connected files
Then you will be prompted to input index of file you need
Text files will be printed directly in console
Others will be opened by default application

Input "-conn edit" to open text file for editing

Similar to "-conn" except it can open Notepad.exe for text file to edit them

Input "-import" to copy files to app directory
Then input full path to new file.
